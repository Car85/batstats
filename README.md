BatStats is a solution for working with data in a fast and dynamic way. Using pivot tables, you can create charts interactively and effortlessly, then download them to incorporate into your storytelling. The frontend is built with React, leveraging the Plotly library, while the backend is developed with Java 23 and the Spring Framework (Spring Boot). Additionally, a lightweight SQLite database is used to save report configurations.
