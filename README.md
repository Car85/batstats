# Batstats
*Generate data charts, reports and dashboards.*

BatStats is a work in progress solution for working with data in a fast and dynamic way. Using pivot tables, you can create charts interactively and effortlessly, then download them to incorporate into your storytelling. The frontend is built with React using TypeScript language, leveraging the Plotly library, while the backend is developed with Java 23 and the Spring Framework (Spring Boot). Additionally, a lightweight SQLite database is used to save report configurations.

The application is still under development and aims to be generic, capable of handling any type of CSV file. As an initial approach, it includes two CSV files with batting and pitching statistics for a baseball team.
